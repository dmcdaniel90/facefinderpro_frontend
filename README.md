# Facial Recognition App

This is a React-based application that uses machine learning to recognize faces in images.

## Learning Journey

This project has been a great opportunity to learn and understand the practical implementation of React and Machine Learning. I've learned how to create a React application from scratch, convert a class-component app to use functional components, manage state with hooks and with state management tooling (Zustand), and integrate with an external Machine Learning API for facial recognition. I've also learned how to write tests for React components and manage dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `facialrecognitionapp` directory
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`

## Usage

To start the application, use the command `npm start` from the `facialrecognitionapp` directory. This will start the application in your default web browser. You can then use the application to upload images and see the facial recognition in action.

## Testing

To run the tests for the application, use the command `npm test` from the `facialrecognitionapp` directory.
